                   me.

                   What are you doing?
                                            CHRIS
                   I don't know... See if it's okay?
                                            CHRIS 
                   Maybe it's gone--
                   Chris...?
                                            ROSE 
                   Be careful!
                                            ROSE 
                   Do you see it?
                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   So in the future the number to
                   call is Animal Control Services.
                                            CHRIS
                   Right. That makes sense.
                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   You two coming up from the city?
                                            CHRIS

                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   And what brings you up--
                                            ROSE
                   I'm from here. The Lake Pontaco
                   area? We're going home.
                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   You got a driver's license?
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh... yeah.
                                            CHRIS 
                   I mean, I don't have a driver's
                   license, I have a state I.D.
                                            ROSE
                   I was driving.
                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   I didn't ask who was driving. I
                   asked him for his I.D.
                                            ROSE
                   My boyfriend shouldn't have to
                   show you his I.D. because he
                   hasn't done anything wrong.
                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   Ma'am, any time there is an
                                            ROSE

                                            CHRIS
                   Baby. It's okay--
                                            ROSE
                   It's bullshit, and you know it.
                   Everything alright up there
                   Crowsie?
                                            OFFICER CROWE
                   Yeah, I'm all good.
                   You guys be careful.
                                            ROSE
                   What? I'm not gonna let anyone
                   fuck with my man.
                                            CHRIS
                   That was some ride or die shit,
                   baby. I like that.
                                            ROSE
                   We're here.
                                            ROSE
                   That's the grounds-keeper... I
                   think his name is Walter.
                                            ROSE 
                   Hi!

                   I miss you guys.
                                            MISSY
                   We miss you, Ro Ro.
                                            CHRIS
                   Hi.
                                            ROSE
                   Chris, these are my parents. Mom,
                   Dad, this is Chris.
                                            CHRIS
                   Good to finally meet you...
                                            DEAN
                   Mr. Armitage will do.
                   Sure.
                                            DEAN
                   I got him.
                   Come here.
                                            DEAN 
                   Call me Dean. We hug around here,
                   Fella.
                   Alright.
                                            DEAN
                   My wife Missy.
                                            CHRIS
                   I've heard so much about you guys.
                                            MISSY
                   Yes, you'll do just fine. So
                   handsome.
                                            ROSE
                   Can we get inside before you guys
                   start embarrassing me?
                                            MISSY
                   Of course, come inside, make
                   yourself at home.
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm fine with the embarrassing by
                   the way; go ahead.
                                            CHRIS
                   Wow.
                                            DEAN
                   "Wow" is good. We'll take wow.
                                            CHRIS
                   I grew up in a one bedroom, so for
                   me, this is ridiculous.
                                            DEAN
                   It ought to be. Lord knows we've
                   done enough work on it through the
                   years...
                                            MISSY
                   How was the ride in?
                                            ROSE
                   We hit a deer.
                                            DEAN MISSY
                   Oh no! Where?
                                            ROSE 
                   I don't know. Down around Lyons
                   road?
                                            CHRIS
                   It came out of nowhere.
                                            MISSY
                   Are you guys okay?
                                            CHRIS ROSE
                   Yeah. Yeah. It just fruck us out.
                                            MISSY 
                   I bet.
                                            DEAN
                   You know what I say. One down... a
                   few hundred thousand to go.
                                            MISSY ROSE
                   Dean. So awful! Dad.
                                            DEAN 
                   What?! Those things are everywhere
                   up here, Chris; like rats. The
                   damage they've done to the ecology
                   alone... Anyway, are we ready for
                   the grand tour?
                                            MISSY
                   Let them unload their bags first.
                                            DEAN
                   Leave `em. Walter will get `em.
                                            ROSE
                   I think we'll manage, Dad.
                                            ROSE
                   You think they wish I was still a
                   kid?
                                            CHRIS
                   I cannot believe they kept it the
                   same.
                                            ROSE
                   So...
                                            CHRIS
                   They're great.
                                            ROSE
                   Yay.
                                            CHRIS
                   No, they're totally sweet.
                                            ROSE
                   I told you they'd love you.
                                            CHRIS
                   What?! Is this you?
                                            ROSE
                   "The Crucible." I was Abigail.
                                            CHRIS
                   I didn't know you acted.
                                            ROSE
                   There's a lot you don't know about
                   me.
                                            CHRIS
                   Wait, what about the tour?
                                            ROSE
                   "The tour?" Are you serious?
                                            CHRIS
                   We just got here. I don't wanna be
                   disrespectful...
                                            ROSE
                   Who gives a fuck? Be
                   disrespectful.
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm serious. Later.
                                            DEAN
                   Frankenstein's monster. Only
                   pieces of the original structure
                   remain; I like to think the soul
                   is in tact though.
                                            DEAN 
                   There are seven bedrooms, ten
                   bathrooms, three indoor dining
                   areas, two study's, two main
                   kitchens. There's an observatory
                   wing on the top floor. And you'd
                   be hard pressed to find a room
                   that doesn't serve as library.
                                            DEAN 
                   That's Jeremy. Rose's brother.
                   He's in Med school.
                                            CHRIS
                   I've heard stories.
                                            DEAN
                   He went through a couple dark
                   spots but came out the other side.
                   You'll meet him later.
                   Oh, cool.
                                            DEAN
                   Mother and Father lived here till
                   the end. They died a few years ago
                   now. Passed away within weeks of
                   each other...
                                            CHRIS
                   I hear that happens a lot.
                                            DEAN
                   "Love" is a powerful thing.
                                            DEAN 
                   My Dad was a runner. A good
                   runner; great sprinter.
                                            DEAN 
                   Oh, In fact, you might find this
                   interesting, he was just beat out
                   by Jessie Owens in the qualifying
                   round for the `36 Olympics in
                   Berlin. That's the one where--
                                            CHRIS
                   --Owens won in front of Hitler.
                                            DEAN
                   You know your history.
                                            CHRIS
                   Not really. That one always just
                   stood out in my mind.
                                            DEAN
                   Of course. One of those perfect
                   moments. There's Hitler on his
                   high horse with his perfect Aryan
                   race, and here comes this black
                   guy to prove him wrong on the
                   world's stage. What a moment.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, tough break for your father
                   though.
                                            DEAN
                   He almost got over it.
                                            DEAN
                   Okay Snowbell just looking.
                   Missy's office. This is where she
                   takes appointments.
                                            CHRIS
                   She's a Therapist right?
                                            DEAN
                   Yeah. One of the best in the
                   world. Not a tidy woman.
                                            CHRIS
                   Like mother like daughter.
                                            CHRIS
                   And you're a surgeon?
                                            DEAN
                   A neurosurgeon; was. I retired
                   early. Now, I pretty much focus on
                   the house and twiddle my thumbs.
                                            DEAN 
                   Oh, downstairs is the wine cellar,
                   the games room, some storage.
                   Apparently a black mold issue down
                   there. Almost everything needs to
                   get thrown out; shame.
                                            DEAN
                   My mother loved her kitchen.
                                            CHRIS
                   That view.
                                            DEAN
                   Oh, Georgina, this is Chris;
                   Rose's boyfriend.
                                            CHRIS
                   Hi.
                                            GEORGINA
                   Hello.-
                                            DEAN
                   Ah ha! But now for the piece de
                   resistance...
                                            DEAN
                   Badminton and bocce ball, croquet;
                   we're a family who loves games.
                   Two other families have properties
                   on lake Pontaco, and they're way
                   on the other side. Total privacy.
                                            DEAN 
                   I know what you're thinking.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah?
                                            DEAN
                   Well-to-do white family; black
                   servants...
                                            CHRIS
                   I wasn't gonna go there.
                                            DEAN
                   You didn't have to. We hired them
                   a few years ago to help care for
                   my parents; they became part of
                   the family. Couldn't bear to let
                   them go. I hate the way it makes
                   us look though...
                                            CHRIS
                   Hey. People need work.
                                            DEAN
                   Yeah.
                                            DEAN 
                   Well, crap.
                   Walter!
                                            DEAN 
                   Another dead bird!
                   Damn things fly into the patio
                   from time to time; break their
                   necks.
                   Iced tea?
                                            MISSY
                   Rose tells us your parents aren't
                   with us.
                                            CHRIS
                   My Dad was never really in the
                   picture. My mom passed away when I
                   was 11; She was hit by a car.
                                            MISSY DEAN
                   Oh, that's awful; so young. I'm so
                   sorry to hear that.
                                            CHRIS 
                   Yeah. My aunt raised me, with my
                   cousins. We didn't have a lot of
                   money or anything, but she's a
                   good person; kept me off the
                   streets. She gave me my first
                   camera.
                                            MISSY
                   You two seem like you've been
                   together for years. How long has
                   it been now?
                                            CHRIS ROSE
                   4 months? 5 months.
                                            CHRIS
                   5? She's right; I'm wrong.
                                            DEAN
                   `Atta boy Chris. Get used to
                   saying that.
                                            MISSY
                   Not a lot of time, anyway. So...?
                   You guys in love or what?
                   Mom.
                                            CHRIS
                   I mean, we've been trying to take
                   it slow but...
                                            MISSY
                   Yep. You're in love. I can tell.
                                            DEAN
                   Can't resist the inevitable.
                                            MISSY
                   And how did you meet, again?
                                            CHRIS
                   At the blood drive.
                                            ROSE
                   Remember when I volunteered at the
                   community center?
                   Ah, yes.
                                            MISSY
                   And he really is so good looking,
                   isn't he? You'd have beautiful
                   babies.
                   I know!
                                            DEAN
                   Uh oh. Get out of here before it's
                   too late!
                                            ROSE
                   Now, all you have to do is just
                   quit smoking.
                                            DEAN
                   Oh no! A smoker!?
                                            MISSY
                   And we were just beginning to like
                   you.
                                            CHRIS
                   No. I'm quitting.
                                            DEAN
                   You should have Missy take care of
                   that for you.
                                            ROSE
                   Oh God.
                                            CHRIS
                   How?
                                            DEAN
                   Hypnosis. Works like a charm.
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh.
                                            DEAN
                   I thought the whole thing was B.S.
                   too. I smoked for 20 years. She
                   puts me under once, now the sight
                   of a cigarette makes me wanna
                   vomit.
                                            MISSY
                   Of course, I'd give you the
                   service for free. You are family
                   after all.
                                            CHRIS
                   Wow. I don't... Thank you. Um, I
                   don't know.
                                            ROSE
                   You guys, normal people don't want
                   strangers fiddling around in their
                   heads.
                                            MISSY
                   If you change your mind... We're
                   just glad you could join us for
                   the big get-together.
                                            CHRIS
                   The get-together?
                                            ROSE
                   The party tomorrow? I told you.
                                            CHRIS
                   I must have forgot.
                                            MISSY
                   Oh, well we host a shindig once a
                   year for our friends.

                   A tradition. Some of my Dad's old
                   social club. Some old patients.

                   Jeremy's home.

                   --No. Mom.
                   Jeremy...
                                            CHRIS
                   No, no... These are good. I wanna
                   hear this.

                   Manners, Rose. Give the guest what
                   he wants.
                                            JEREMY
                   Yeah, Rose.
                                            ROSE
                   I hate you.
                                            JEREMY
                   Connor Garfield was on my lacrosse
                   team. Huge guy, like 6'3", and
                   crazy, just like "Looney Tunes,"
                   right? We had thrown a party--
                   You did.
                                            JEREMY
                   I think my parents were in Greece
                   or something. We had gotten into
                   their liquor cabinet and we're all
                   shit-faced.
                                            MISSY
                   No you weren't. Were you?
                                            JEREMY
                   We put water in the bottles so you
                   wouldn't know. Let me finish.
                   Okay, so I'm upstairs in my
                   parents' bathroom hooking up with
                   Jenny Richardson. Hottest girl in
                   our class.
                                            MISSY
                   Uch.
                                            ROSE
                   You realize you're coming off like
                   a total douche right now, right?
                                            JEREMY
                   Thanks. All of a sudden Connor
                   starts banging on the bathroom
                   door, right? I open it, and he's
                   got blood gushing out of his mouth
                   and he's screaming "Your thith-ter
                   bit my fuckin' thongue off!!!!"
                                            CHRIS
                   Whoa, what?
                                            JEREMY
                   Sure enough, there is a centimeter
                   of tongue meat missing right here.
                                            CHRIS
                   Ahhhh! You bit him?
                                            ROSE
                   He cornered me and shoved his
                   tongue in my mouth, so yeah.
                                            CHRIS
                   Damn. That's badass, Bae.
                                            MISSY
                   I'm going to see how dessert is
                   coming along.
                   Maybe we can change the
                   conversation to something a little
                   lighter.
                                            ROSE
                   Yeah, great story. Thanks for
                   making it totally uncomfortable.
                                            DEAN
                   Okay, new subject. Chris, Yanks or
                   Mets?
                                            CHRIS
                   Ah, Orioles. My mom was from
                                            JEREMY
                   You an MMA fan?
                                            ROSE
                   Oh God.
                                            JEREMY
                   What?
                                            DEAN
                   She's right. Let someone else talk
                   for a bit.
                                            JEREMY
                   You've had your chance. He's
                   dating my sister. I can't bond
                   with the guy?
                                            CHRIS
                   You mean like UFC? Yeah, nah. Too
                   brutal for me. I'm a lover, not a
                   fighter.
                                            JEREMY
                   You ever get into street fights as
                   a kid?
                                            CHRIS
                   Not really. I did take Judo for
                   after-school in 1st grade.
                                            ROSE
                   Awww.
                                            JEREMY
                   Cause, with your frame, your
                   genetic make-up? If you pushed
                   your body, I mean really trained,
                   you'd be a beast.
                                            CHRIS
                   Cool... Thanks?
                                            MISSY
                   What'd I miss?
                                            ROSE
                   More ramblings from King Awkward.
                                            JEREMY
                   We're talking about sports.
                   Stand up. Let me show you
                   something.
                                            MISSY
                   No karate at the dinner table.
                                            JEREMY
                   It's not karate, it's jiu-jitsu.
                                            CHRIS
                   I've got a rule. I don't play-
                   fight with drunk dudes.
                                            JEREMY
                                            DEAN
                   --Alright, enough Jeremy!

                   I wasn't going to hurt him.
                                            ROSE
                   And that's my brother.
                                            MISSY
                   Quick fix?
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah. Nerves got me I guess.
                                            MISSY
                   Come. Let's nip this in the bud.
                                            CHRIS
                   I still don't know if this is
                   right for me.
                                            MISSY
                   There really is no need to be
                   nervous.
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm good. The dude was running out
                   there. Scared me.
                                            MISSY
                   Walter starts early every day.
                   He's borderline obsessive
                   compulsive. Tea?
                                            CHRIS
                   Nah, I'm good. It'll keep me up.
                                            MISSY
                   How's the bed. Good?
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah.
                                            MISSY
                   Comfortable enough?
                                            CHRIS
                   It's perfect, thanks.
                                            MISSY
                   Enough sheets?
                   Yep.
                                            CHRIS 
                   So, how does this work? Are you
                   going to swing a pocket watch in
                   front of my face?
                                            MISSY
                   You watch a lot of Television.
                   Now, you are feeling very
                   sleeepy...
                                            MISSY 
                   We do use focal points sometimes,
                   but just about any object or
                   simple motion can guide someone to
                   a state of heightened
                   suggestibility.
                                            CHRIS
                   Heightened suggestibility. Okay,
                   where do we start?
                                            MISSY
                   Your childhood.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, my memory sucks.
                                            MISSY
                   Wounds get locked in your heart
                   and they fester and grow into ugly
                   little things like depression and
                   addiction. But, they are all in
                   there somewhere. All we need to do
                   is find the key.
                                            CHRIS
                   I guess if it makes me quit...
                   Wait... Has it started--?
                                            MISSY
                   --we're going to go back to a
                   place that might be uncomfortable
                   for you. Your Mother's death to be
                   specific. Were you there when she
                   was hit?
                                            CHRIS
                   I was home. I was watching TV.
                                            MISSY
                   Let's go back there. Hear this
                   place. Let the vibrations rush run
                   through your body and ears. Hear
                   it... Find it... Tell me when you
                   find it.
                                            CHRIS
                   Okay... Yeah, I found it.
                                            MISSY
                   Good. How did you find out she
                   died?
                                            CHRIS
                   I knew it. She was never late
                   after work. When she didn't come
                   home, I just knew something was
                   wrong.
                                            MISSY
                   Good. Now touch. Feel your
                   surroundings. Feel every part of
                   your body and what you touched.
                   Feel it. Find it... Tell me when
                   you find it...
                   Tell me when you find it.
                   I found it.
                                            MISSY
                   You said `you knew something was
                   wrong.' What did you do?
                   Nothing.
                   Nothing?
                                            CHRIS
                   I just sat there. Watching TV.
                                            MISSY
                   You didn't call someone? Your Aunt
                   or the police?
                   No.
                   Why not?
                                            CHRIS
                   I don't know. I thought if I did,
                   it would make it real.
                                            MISSY
                   Next is smell and taste. Breathe
                   in and let the scent fill your
                   nose. Smell that place. Taste it.
                   Find it.
                   Tell me. Tell me when you find it.
                                            CHRIS
                   I found it.
                                            MISSY
                   Good. Now lastly, you must see it.
                   Let the light flood into your
                   eyes. Every color, every detail.
                   See it. See it. Find it.
                   Tell me when--
                                            CHRIS
                   --Found it.

                   You think it was your fault.
                                            MISSY 
                   I want you to feel that fear
                   again, Chris.
                                            CHRIS
                   I don't want to.
                                            MISSY
                   It's okay. I'm here.
                                            MISSY 
                   Are you afraid now? Paralyzed like
                   that day?
                                            MISSY 
                   Good. Now sink into the floor.
                                            CHRIS
                                            MISSY
                   Sink! Now!
                                            MISSY
                   Good. Good. Sink. Sink.
                                            CHRIS
                   No! NO!!! I'm done! Bring me back!
                   Please!!!!
                                            CHRIS 
                   Mrs. Armitage!!!
                                            MISSY
                   Now you are in the Sunken Place.
                                            CHRIS
                   Something's down here...
                                            CHRIS 
                   Bring me back. Bring me back.
                   Bring me back. Bring me back...
                                            CHRIS 
                   Bring me back. Bring me back.
                   Bring me back.
                                            CHRIS 
                   What's up?
                                            CHRIS 
                   They working you good out here,
                   huh?
                                            WALTER
                   Nothing I don't want to be doing.
                                            CHRIS
                   Ha!
                                            CHRIS 
                   Yeah... yeah. No, I can tell. I
                   never really got to meet you
                   actually, up close. I'm Chris.
                                            WALTER
                   I know who you are. You're Rose's
                   friend.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah. That's one way to put it.
                   So, where you from originally?
                                            WALTER
                   She is lovely isn't she?
                                            CHRIS
                   Rose? Yeah, she is...
                                            WALTER
                   One of a kind; a real doggone
                   keeper.
                                            WALTER 
                   Sorry if I scared you last night.
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh, yeah. Actually, I guess I was
                   pretty drunk.
                                            CHRIS 
                   I don't remember much.
                                            WALTER
                   And the hypnosis? Did it work?
                                            CHRIS
                   Hypnosis? No, I didn't...
                                            WALTER
                   Well, I should get back to work.
                                            CHRIS
                   There's another bird...
                                            ROSE
                   Hi. Where have you been?
                                            CHRIS
                   Out. Taking pictures. Hey, so I
                   think your mom hypnotised me last
                   night.
                                            ROSE
                   Wait, what?
                                            CHRIS
                   I think I snuck out for a smoke,
                   and she caught me and offered? I
                   don't know. I must have agreed to
                   it `cause the thing just made me
                   nauseous.
                                            ROSE
                   Okay. Well then that's good,
                   right?
                                            CHRIS
                   No, not good. I can barely
                   remember any of it even happening;
                   I don't like that. Plus I had
                   these fucked up dreams.
                                            ROSE
                   That happened to me too.
                   What did?
                                            ROSE
                   The nightmares. When I was a kid.
                   She hypnotized me once for stage
                   fright, and I had the craziest
                   nightmares, but it worked...
                                            CHRIS
                   And, what's the deal with the
                   help?
                                            ROSE
                   Like... The iced tea thing? Yeah
                   that was weird.
                                            CHRIS
                   That, but also the lawn-mower guy
                   creepin' me the fuck out too.
                                            ROSE
                   Why? Did he say something?
                                            CHRIS
                   It's not what he says, it's how he
                   says it. You know?
                                            ROSE
                   Yeah, something about them
                   seems... different.
                                            ROSE 
                   They're here.
                                            GORDON
                   Nice to meet you, Chris. Nice to
                   meet you indeed.
                   Good grip.
                                            CHRIS
                   Thanks. You too.
                                            GORDON
                   You ever play golf?
                                            CHRIS
                   Once, actually; a few years ago. I
                   wasn't very good.
                                            EMILY
                   Gordon was a professional golfer
                   for years.
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh? No kidding.
                                            GORDON
                   Can't quite swing the hips like I
                   used to though. You know, I met
                   Tiger.
                                            ROSE CHRIS
                   Wow, that's great. Cool.
                                            EMILY
                   Gordon loves Tiger.
                                            GORDON
                   Best I've ever seen. Ever, hands
                   down. Let's see your form.
                                            CHRIS
                   Me? I could barely hit the thing.
                                            GORDON
                   Show me...
                                            GORDON 
                   If I knew what I know now at your
                   age? Now then I could really play.
                                            CHRIS
                   It'd be kind of a waste of time
                   travel though.
                                            LISA
                   How handsome is he?
                                            ROSE
                   Extremely.
                                            LISA
                   Not bad huh, Nelson?
                                            NELSON
                   Eh?
                                            LISA
                   So, is it true? The love making.
                   Is it better?
                   Wow. Um..
                                            LISA
                   I'm being too forward?
                                            ROSE
                   We'll talk later.
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh, will you now?
                                            APRIL
                   Who even cares about skin color?
                   My God.
                                            CHRIS
                   Right. I mean--
                                            PARKER
                   The world cares, April. But it's
                   not a question of physical
                   superiority, it's "What skin color
                   is more culturally advantageous?"
                                            ROSE
                   "Advantageous?"
                                            PARKER
                   Fairer skin is has been in favor'
                   the last couple of thousands of
                   years, but the pendulum has swung
                   back again hasn't it..?
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm sorry. I'm going to get
                   another drink.
                                            PARKER
                   I didn't mean to offend him.
                                            ROSE
                   Really? `Cause you have yet to say
                   anything that's not a blanket
                   statement about race.
                                            PARKER
                   Now, Rose.--

                   It's good to see another brother
                   around here.
                                            ANDRE
                   Yes, of course it is.
                                            CHRIS
                   Who do you know?
                                            ANDRE
                   Why, the Armitage's of course.
                   We're friends of the family.
                                            PHIL
                   There you are. Here, put this
                   somewhere.
                                            PHIL 
                   Oh, hello. I'm Phil... and you
                   are...?
                                            CHRIS
                   Chris. Rose's boyfriend.
                                            PHIL
                   Fantastic. Logan and I know Rose
                   very well.
                                            ANDRE
                   I'm sorry, where are my manners.
                   Logan, Logan King.
                   Chris was just telling me that he
                   felt more comfortable with my
                   being here.
                                            PHIL
                   That's nice. Logan, I hate to tear
                   you away, dear, but the Wincott's
                   were asking about you.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   Ah, well it was nice meeting you
                   Chris.
                                            CHRIS
                   Sure.
                                            ROSE
                   Where's your drink?
                                            CHRIS
                   What? Oh, I forgot.
                   Hello!
                                            DEAN 
                   Achem! Once again, I want to thank
                   you all for coming. Words cannot
                   express how much it means to us
                   that after all these years we can
                   all still get together and share.
                   I'm reminded of stories of how the
                   knights of old would gather in
                   honor of a new crusade...
                                            JIM
                   Ignorant shit...
                   Who?
                                            JIM
                   All of them. Ignorant assholes.
                   They have no idea what real people
                   go through.
                                            CHRIS
                   I guess people only see what's in
                   front of them.
                   I mean...
                                            JIM
                   Heh. No, you're right. And usually
                   not even that much. That's people.
                                            JIM 
                   Jim Hudson.
                                            JIM
                   I know who you are. I'm an admirer
                   of your work; you have a great
                   eye...
                                            CHRIS
                   Wait. Jim Hudson... of Hudson
                   Galleries?
                                            JIM
                   The irony of being a blind art
                   dealer isn't lost on me.
                                            CHRIS
                   How do you do it?
                                            JIM
                   I have an assistant describe work
                   to me. You've got something... The
                   images you capture... so brutally
                   melancholic. Powerful stuff.
                                            CHRIS
                   Thank you. Yeah, I just like
                   finding the beauty in abandoned
                   things.
                                            JIM
                   I used to dabble myself.
                   Wilderness mostly. I submitted to
                   Nat Geo 14 times before realizing
                   I didn't have "the eye" for it;
                   Began dealing. And then, of
                   course, my vision went to shit.
                   Damn.
                                            JIM
                   I know. Life can be a sick joke.
                   One day you're working in a dark
                   room, and the next day - BAM. You
                   wake up in the dark. Genetic
                   disease.
                                            CHRIS
                   Shit ain't fair, man.
                                            JIM
                   Yeah.
                                            JEREMY
                   Chris, we need you...
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, sure.
                   Nice to meet you.
                                            JIM
                   Stop by the gallery some time.
                   Bout time you had a solo show.
                                            CHRIS
                   Really? Wow, okay. Thank you. That
                   would be a game changer.
                                            JIM
                   I think we could do wonderful
                   things together.
                                            JEREMY
                   HA! Come on. You can do better
                   than that!
                                            CHRIS
                   Not my game, what can I say.
                                            JEREMY
                   Yeah, I see that.
                                            ROSE
                   Shut up Jeremy.
                                            JEREMY
                   I'm just saying, if your boy isn't
                   gonna bring his `A' game, we might
                   as well bring Mom up here.
                                            CHRIS
                   Whoa, whoa, okay. Now we talkin'
                   smack huh?
                                            CHRIS 
                   Boom!
                                            ROSE
                   Yay, baby!
                                            JEREMY
                   See, that's what I'm talking
                   about!!! Okay, again!
                                            CHRIS
                   Hold up. Here.
                                            ROSE
                   Where are you--
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
                                            ROSE
                   Hey! You okay?
                                            CHRIS
                   The housekeeper unplugged my
                   phone.
                                            CHRIS 
                   I'm trying to check in with Rod,
                   and I got no juice.
                                            ROSE
                   I'm sure it was an honest mistake.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, or maybe not. Maybe she
                   doesn't like the fact that I'm
                   with you.
                   Chris...
                                            CHRIS
                   What? It's a thing.
                                            ROSE
                   You think my family's housekeeper
                   gives a shit who you're with?
                   That's crazy bae.
                                            CHRIS
                   Forget it. Nevermind.
                                            ROSE
                   Look, I get it. This whole thing
                   is stressful. I mean, they're
                   circling you like hyenas down
                   there. I just don't get why you're
                   taking it out on George and
                   Walter.
                                            CHRIS
                   You're right. I'm being paranoid.
                   I just need a minute and I'll be
                   down.
                                            ROSE
                   Fine.
                                            ROD
                   Hey.
                                            CHRIS
                   Bruh. What's up?
                                            ROD
                   Not much. Sid's chillin'. We
                   eatin' burgers. What's up with
                   you?
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah...
                                            ROD
                   Uh oh. That doesn't sound good.
                                            CHRIS
                   They just got me over here meeting
                   all the family friends. It's like
                   they never met a black dude that
                   doesn't work for them or some
                   shit.
                                            ROD
                   Oh, they got you on display?
                                            CHRIS
                   Exactly. Also, I got hypnotised
                   last night...
                                            ROD
                   Nigga, what the fuck? Oh, Hell no!
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, to quit smoking. Rose's mom
                   is a hypnotherapist--
                                            ROD
                   --Nope. I don't give a fuck if
                   she's Dr. Drew up in this bitch.
                   You ain't getting in my head.
                                            CHRIS
                   Right.
                                            ROD
                   Who knows what they'll make you
                   do. You know white people into
                   some crazy sex slave shit.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, I'm like 99% sure they're
                   not a kinky sex family, but-
                                            ROD
                   Why not? Jeffery Dahmer ate
                   niggas' heads, but that was after
                   he fucked the heads.
                                            ROD 
                   You think they saw that shit
                   coming? Hell no.
                                            ROD 
                   One second they think they just
                   gonna suck some dick, next second
                   they sucking dick but their head
                   isn't on their body Chris.
                                            CHRIS
                   And thanks for that image, right
                   there.
                                            ROD
                   I saw that on A&E, so that's real
                   life.
                                            CHRIS
                   It's the black people out here
                   that are the weirdest. The help.
                   It's like they're possessed or...
                                            ROD
                   Hypnotised.
                                            ROD
                   I'm just connecting the dots you
                   presenting me with. The mom
                   puttin' trances on niggas and
                   fuckin' them. It's clear as day
                   and that's fucked up. She hot?
                                            CHRIS
                   What's fucked up is: You're the
                   first line of defense against
                   terrorism.
                                            ROD
                   This is good shit tho.
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh, and the one other black guest
                   is like the whitest-most dude at
                   the party.
                                            CHRIS 
                   I mean Rod, if you could see what
                   this dude is wearing.
                                            ROD
                   Send me a picture. You are a
                   photographer.
                                            ROD 
                   You should be documentin' this
                   shit.
                                            CHRIS

                                            ROD
                   And yo, don't say I didn't warn
                   you `cause my ass sure as Hell
                   ain't coming up to the country to
                   save you from no fuckin' witch
                   coven... Unless the mom's hot. She
                   hot?
                                            CHRIS
                   Thanks Rod, bye.
                   Hello.
                   Hi.
                                            GEORGINA
                   I owe you an apology. I shouldn't
                   be touching things that don't
                   belong to me.
                                            CHRIS
                   Oh, no. It's cool. I was just
                   confused.
                                            GEORGINA
                   I lifted your cellular phone this
                   morning to wipe down the dresser
                   and it accidentally came undone,
                   see?
                   Yeah, I--
                                            GEORGINA
                   Rather than meddle with it
                   further, I left it that way.
                                            CHRIS
                   Really, it's okay. I didn't mean
                   to rat you out.
                                            CHRIS 
                   ...get you in trouble.
                                            GEORGINA
                   Oh no, no, no, no, no, no...
                   Aren't you the sweetest thing? Not
                   at all. The Armitages are so good
                   to us; They treat us like family.
                                            DEAN
                   Chris! There you are. I wanted to
                   introduce you to some old friends.
                   We'll do it quickly. Down the
                   line: David and Marcia Wincott,
                   Ronald and Celia Jeffries, Hiroki
                   Tanaka, and Fredrich and Jessika
                   Walden.
                                            CHRIS
                   Too many names to remember but...
                                            HIROKI
                   Can we ask him questions?
                                            DEAN
                   Of course.
                                            HIROKI
                   Do you find that being African
                   American has more advantages or
                   disadvantages in the modern world?
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, I don't know, man.
                                            CHRIS 
                   That's actually a great question.
                   Logan! They were asking me about
                   the African American experience.
                   Maybe you could take this one.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   My life as an African American has
                   been, for the most part, very
                   good. It's hard to be too specific
                   as I haven't much desired to leave
                   the house in a while.
                                            PHIL
                   We've become homebodies...
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   But recently, even when you go to
                   the city, I've just had no
                   interest.
                   The chores are my sanctu--
                                            CHRIS
                   Shit.
                                            PHIL
                   Logan?
                   Get out.
                                            CHRIS
                   Hey, man, I'm sorry, I--
                                            ANDRE
                   GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!
                                            ROSE
                   What the Hell was that?
                                            DEAN
                   It was a seizure.
                                            ROSE
                   A seizure?
                                            DEAN
                   Yes. Logan's okay. Missy's with
                   him now. Are you okay Chris?
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah. Why did he come at me like
                   that?
                                            ROSE
                   Yeah seizures don't make people
                   attack people, I'm sorry.
                                            DEAN
                   It was an abnormal manifestation
                   but yes, actually, sometimes they
                   do. The flash on your phone must
                   have triggered it.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   Well, I do believe I owe you all
                   an apology.
                                            MISSY
                   We're just glad you're feeling
                   yourself again.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   Well yes I am. It's quite like
                   being trapped in a dark room and
                   watching my experiences through a
                   window. Thank God you and Dean
                   were here to calm me down.
                                            DEAN
                   It's a simple glitch of the brain.
                   Nothing to be afraid of.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   I know I scared you all quite a
                   bit.. especially you Chris.
                                            CHRIS
                   No, I'm sorry about the flash. I
                   didn't know.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   Of course. How could you have?
                                            PHIL
                   You shouldn't have been drinking
                   either.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   As I said I'm feeling much better
                   now, but you'll all have to
                   proceed without the aid of my
                   marvellous wit; the whole thing
                   has left me a quite a bit
                   exhausted.
                                            DEAN
                   Of course.
                                            ANDRE/LOGAN
                   It was nice meeting you.
                                            CHRIS
                   Yeah, you too.
                                            DEAN
                   Let's do sparklers shall we?
                   Brighten the mood?
                   Let's go.
                                            MISSY
                   Anybody need a drink?
                                            ROSE
                   We're going on a walk.
                                            CHRIS
                   My cousin is epileptic. That
                   wasn't a seizure.
                                            ROSE
                   Honestly? That was one of the
                   strangest things I've ever seen in
                   my life.
                                            CHRIS
                   Also, this is gonna sound weird,
                   but when he got up in my face like
                   that, I got the feeling like I
                   knew that guy.
                                            CHRIS
                   Let's go back home tonight.
                                            ROSE
                   What? Wait, no.
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm just... Something doesn't feel
                   right.
                                            ROSE
                   You mean with us?
                                            CHRIS
                   No. With this whole situation! I
                   just... I can't explain but I need
                   you to trust me. Let's just go. It
                   doesn't even have to be a big
                   deal.
                                            ROSE
                   It is a big deal. It's my family.
                   I wouldn't even know what to tell
                   them.
                                            ROSE
                   Yes, it's weird. There are a lot
                   of ways I wish this was going
                   different. I wish my brother
                   wasn't a cock. I wish my parents
                   friends were chill; but just
                   because it's tough, it doesn't
                   mean you run away...
                   Baby, I--

                   ...I'm late.
                   Late?

                   I should've got my period like
                   last week.
                   Oh.
                                            ROSE
                   I mean, I did change my birth
                   control, so it could just be that,
                   but...
                   So...?
                                            CHRIS
                   I don't know what to say.
                                            ROSE
                   Okay... Try any emotional response
                   whatsoever.

                   If you wanna go then go. I'm not
                   going to force you to stay but I'm
                   not leaving.

                   I told you about the night my mom
                   died. How I didn't call 911;
                   didn't go out looking for her.

                   One hour went by, then two,
                   three... I just sat there... I
                   just watched TV.
                                            ROSE
                   It wasn't your fault--
                                            CHRIS
                   I found out later she had survived
                   the initial hit.
                                            CHRIS 
                   She laid there bleeding by the
                   side of the road all night, cold
                   and alone. And that's how she died
                   in the early morning... Cold and
                   alone. And I was watching TV.
                                            CHRIS 
                   There was time. If someone was
                   looking for her, there was time.
                   But no one was looking.

                   Yeah... yeah. So, I'm not gonna
                   leave here without you. I`m not
                   going to abandon you. Never.

                   Fuck it. Come on. Let's go back

                                            ROSE
                   Yeah. I mean, you're right. This
                   sucks. I'll go back with you. I'll
                   make something up.
                                            CHRIS

                   ...Teresa's sister! Worked at the
                   movie theatre on 8th;
                                            ROD 
                   got us into the movie a couple of
                   times; Rush hour 2 and, um Usual
                   Suspect.

                   Yeah. That is him. But...

                   This is so fuckin' crazy. He's
                   different now.
                                            ROD
                   Different? How?
                                            CHRIS
                   Different. Slower... I mean he was
                   street; now he's all like...
                   white- seeming. Oh, plus he's gay!
                                            ROD
                   No, he ain't.
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm telling you: He's gay, I met
                   his man. He's--
                                            ROD
                   Chris, you in a fucked up Eyes

                                            CHRIS
                   Um... Looking for my camera.
                                            CHRIS 
                   Where are the keys..? I gotta put
                   our bags in the trunk.
                                            ROSE
                   Walter can do that.
                                            CHRIS
                   Nah, I'll do it.
                                            ROSE
                   I was just looking for them. I'm
                   such a mess, will you help me?
                                            ROSE
                   Chris... What's wrong?
                   Nothing.
                                            JEREMY
                   Where are you going? The party's
                   just getting started.
                                            CHRIS
                   I'm going to the car; see if we
                   left the keys in there.
                                            MISSY
                   I just made tea.
                   I'm good.
                                            ROSE
                   Oh, I know where they are. In my
                   bag. Duh.
                                            MISSY
                   You're leaving us.
                   Yeah.
                                            MISSY
                   Is something wrong?
                                            CHRIS
                   No. Well, yeah... Um.

                   His dog is not well. He needs to
                   go to the vet first thing in the
                                            DEAN
                   What is your purpose, Chris?
                   What?
                                            DEAN
                   In life? What is your purpose..?
                                            CHRIS
                   Right now, it's finding the keys.
                                            DEAN
                   We've been looking for our purpose
                   for such a long time. Fire has
                   mesmerized man since the Stone
                   Age. It is a reflection of our
                   impermanence in the world. Fire is
                   born, it breathes and then it
                   dies.
                   Rose...
                                            ROSE
                   I'm looking.
                                            CHRIS
                   Rose, what is this shit?!
                                            DEAN
                   There's a reason we worship the
                   Sun, Chris. He who lights the way
                   through the darkness of life. He
                   in all his glory was around long
                   before us and will be here long
                   after we are gone, but he too will
                   die some day! That's right even
                   the Sun God will die. It is no
                   less mortal than we, but it
                   inspires us to defy it! So what do
                   we do?--
                   --Rose.--
                                            DEAN
                   --What do we do?! We baptize
                   ourselves in the firewater!
                                            DEAN 
                   We bathe in his reflection, for
                   one chance to emerge having defied
                   death!
                                            DEAN 
                   You'd take that baptism wouldn't
                   you, Chris? The baptism of
                   immortality?
                                            CHRIS
                   I was raised Episcopalian.

                   Whoa! Be careful, bro.
                                            MISSY
                   Don't hurt him, Jeremy.
                                            JEREMY
                   What? I'm not doing anything.
                                            DEAN
                   Listen, Chris--
                                            CHRIS
                   --I don't know what you're saying!
                                            DEAN
                   I'm saying that we've found OUR
                   PURPOSE!!! There must be a
                   sacrifice! Sacrifice is essential
                   for the righteous to achieve our
                   true potential. A vessel must be
                   comprised. A host must be born!!!
                                            CHRIS
                   Rose! The keys!!!
                                            ROSE
                   Oh baby... You know I can't give
                   you the keys.
                   Oh shit!
                   Is he hurt?
                                            CHRIS
                   What the fuck?
                                            JEREMY
                   Did you see him drop?
                   He hit his head pretty good.
                   It's just a bump. He's fine.
                   Rose!!!
                   Why do you push them, Dean?
                   It's important to me that they
                   acknowledge the purpose.
                   Why do you think he ran?
                   Rose gave it away.
                   He already knew.
                   Take him to the games room.
                   Jeremy, get the legs. Dean, help
                   him.
                                            JEREMY
                   I can take him alone.
                   No. We've already damaged him
                   enough. Dean, please.
                                            CHRIS
                   Rose!? No, no, no, no. Shit,
                   shit...
                                            DEAN
                   You're going to drop him.
                                            JEREMY
                   No I'm not.
                   Be careful what you say, everyone.
                   He can hear every word.
                   Rose!!!!
                   It doesn't matter any more does
                   it?

                   brought to your authorizing
                   officer, right?
                                            ROD
                   It's not TSA business, ma'am.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   Please don't call me "ma'am," or
                   we're not gonna get along. How can
                   I help you, Rod Williams from the
                   TSA?
                                            CHRIS
                   Here it is: My boy Chris has been
                   missing for two days.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   Your son is missing?
                                            ROD
                   No, sorry, not my son, my boy.
                   He's my friend. He's 26. His name
                   is Chris... Washington...
                                            ROD 
                   He left town on Friday with his
                   girlfriend Rose... Armitage...
                   She's white.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   That's four days ago.
                                            ROD
                   Yeah, I mean he's only been
                   MISSING for two days. He was
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   --I'm gonna stop you right there.
                   Now you know the minimum amount of
                   time without contact before you
                   can file a missing persons report
                                            ROD
                   --Three days I know, but I have
                   reason to believe he's been
                   abducted.

                   Go on.
                                            ROD
                   Chris was set to come back home on
                   Sunday. I was watching his dog
                   Sid.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   That's Sid.
                                            ROD
                   Yup. Cute right? Now look...
                                            ROD 
                   Chris sent me this which he took
                   at the girlfriend's parents house.
                   That's Andre Hayworth, a guy we
                   knew from back in the day. Come to
                   find out he went missing 6 months
                   ago in an affluent suburb upstate.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   Don't look too missing to me.
                                            ROD
                   Well that's the thing. We found
                   him and now, according to Chris,
                   he's gay with a different
                   personality.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   Gay?
                                            ROD
                   But he didn't used to be.
                                            DETECTIVE LATOYA
                   I think he might just argue with
                   you on that one.
                                            ROD
                   I know what I'm about to say is
                   gonna sound crazy.

                   You ready for this...? I think
                   this family is abducting black
                   people and brainwashing them to
                   work for them as sex slaves and
                   shit... Sorry.

                   ...Brainwashing?
                                            ROD
                   Yeah.

                   Hold on one second.
                   Garcia, Frostie, get in here a
                   second.
                   I want you to tell these officers
                   exactly what you just told me.
                                            ROD
                   ...See, I don't know if the
                   hypnosis makes you a slave or if
                   just turns you gay or what, but
                   they already got two brothers that
                   we know of, and who knows how many
                   more there could be.

                   Okay. Okay! What do you want? You

                   Hi.

                   He left like two days ago.
                   He left?
                                            ROSE
                   We got in a fight. He got all
                   paranoid and flipped out; He took
                   a cab home. He forgot his phone.
                   Wait... You haven't seen him?
                                            ROD
                   No. He never made it back here.
                                            ROSE
                   Oh my God.

                   I've been calling. I went to the
                   police and everything.
                   Hello?
                                            ROSE
                   What did you say?
                                            ROD
                   I told them he was missing.
                   Uh huh...
                                            ROD
                   So... What cab company did he use?
                                            ROSE
                   I don't know. A local one I'm
                   guessing. Maybe uber? Wait, I'm so
                   confused...
                                            ROD
                   Hold on a second.

                   So, last time Chris and I talked,
                   he told me your mom hypnotized
                   him?
                                            ROSE
                   Rod, just stop.
                                            ROD
                   Huh?
                                            ROSE
                   I know why you're calling.
                                            ROD
                   Why is that?
                                            ROSE
                   Come on. I mean, it's kind of
                   obvious.
                                            ROD
                   What?
                                            ROSE
                   That there's something between us.
                                            ROD
                   No. I'm calling about Chris.
                                            ROSE
                   We'd all go out drinking... I
                   remember you looking at me.
                                            ROD
                   That's my best friend. If you did
                                            ROSE
                   I know you think about fucking me,
                   Rod.
                                            ROD
                   --No. You crazy... No.

                   One whose sole purpose for many
                   many years has been a search for a
                   very powerful object. Armitage
                   lineage redefined the nature of
                   that search. They proved that the
                   power didn't just exist in that
                   object; You see, with science the
                   Armitage's created a miracle.

                   You hypnotize me? Break my will..?
                   Make me a slave like the others?
                   This is some crazy racist shit.
                                            JIM
                   No. Not racist, Chris. We don't
                   hate you. We want to be you... You
                   are not going to be a slave.
                   You're going to be a vessel.

                   Missy's hypnosis was merely to

                   prepare you psychologically...
                   For what?

                   For the procedure.

                   Are you ready...? Drum roll
                   please. Brain transplantation.
                   Some say it could never be done;

                   They experimented for centuries,
                   but it turned out re-linking the
                   brain to a foreign central nervous
                   system was impossible. The nerve
                   connections are far too intricate
                   and delicate.
                                            CHRIS
                   What the fuck?

                   Dean's the only guy who really
                   gets the science. He's the one who
                   discovered that full brain
                   transplantation isn't actually
                   necessary to transfer the soul,
                   and that partial brain
                   transplantation solves the little
                   nerve ending problem.
                                            CHRIS
                   No.

                   Okay so... You see the blue part?
                   That's the piece of your brain
                   that's all rooted in the nervous
                   system. So that stays; keeping
                   those tricky little connections
                   intact. The rest is discarded.
                   Then they'll remove the red part
                   of my brain from my skull and put
                   in yours. Your "blue" and my "red"
                   basically absorb each other. And
                   apparently the brain heals
                   surprisingly fast, so assuming
                   everything goes as planned, we

                   Your red part? It'll be discarded,
                   but don't worry. You wont be gone.
                   Well not completely. You'll still
                   be in there somewhere; limited
                   consciousness of course;
                                            JIM 
                   you'll still be able to see and
                   hear but your existence will be as
                   a passenger... an audience. You
                   will live in...

                   Yes. That's what she calls it.
                   Good! So you understand, I'll
                   control the motor functions, the
                   will of our body, effectively

                   As far as the world is concerned.
                   It's still a pretty new operation.
                   Some kinks. We're supposed to stay
                   away from flashes of light for
                   example. They can trigger a
                   "momentary lapse in control of
                   motor functions..."

                   Why black people?
                                            JIM
                   Well, because you get the highest
                   bids. For the last decade or so
                   anyway. I wish it was less simple
                   than that, but it's not. You're in
                   fashion, baby!
                                            JIM 
                   Honestly though, personally..? I
                   couldn't give two shits about
                   race. I don't care if you're
                   black, brown, green, purple...
                   whatever. What I want is so much
                   deeper: Your eye, man. I want
                   those things you see through.
                                            CHRIS
                   That's crazy.
                                            JIM
                   Take it as a compliment.
